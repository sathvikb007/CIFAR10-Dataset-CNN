# CIFAR10-Dataset-CNN

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. 
There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset can be previewed and downloaded from the link given below:

The project aims to classify the given data into its appropriate class by employing a 6 layered
convolutional neural network. It utilizes convolutional, pooling, regularization and data augmentation 
techniques . Various models have been trained and the last model in the file has achieved a training 
and test accuracy of 86.35% each.

The code is written in Python with the help of the popular deep learning framework Keras.
